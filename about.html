        <li><b>The Lord of the Rings</b>
        <p>
            fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien initially published in three parts as The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), 
            The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1955). The novel, set in the Third Age of Middle-earth, 
            formed a sequel to Tolkien’s The Hobbit (1937) and was succeeded by his posthumous The Silmarillion (1977).
             The Lord of the Rings is the saga of a group of sometimes reluctant heroes who set forth to save their 
             world from consummate evil. Its many worlds and creatures were drawn from Tolkien’s 
             extensive knowledge of philology and folklore.

        <li><b>Black Hawk Down</b>
        <p>
            is a 2001 war film directed and produced by Ridley Scott, and co-produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, 
            from a screenplay by Ken Nolan. It is based on the 1999 non-fiction book of the same name by journalist Mark Bowden, 
            about the U.S. military's 1993 raid in Mogadishu. The film features a large ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, 
            Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Piven and Tom Hardy in his first film role.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black Hawk Down had a limited release on December 28, 2001, and went into the public on January 18, 2002. 
            The film received positive reviews from film critics, although it was heavily criticized for its inaccuracies, 
            and sparked controversy for its portrayal of Somalis. The film performed modestly well at the box office,
             grossing $172 million worldwide against a production budget of $92 to $110 million
